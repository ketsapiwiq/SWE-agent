1. duplicate the command search_www.sh (read the code at config/commands/search_www.sh) to do a curl_www.sh that just queries a page and extracts its meaningful info (you can use beautifulsoup, and CHECK ITS DOCS ONLINE).

2. Add the command to config/custom.yaml

3. Use the command curl_www to check for the readme of https://github.com/nilsherzig/LLocalSearch/ 

4. and write a markdown note on how we could add commands in SWE agent that use LlocalSearch's api if there is one
